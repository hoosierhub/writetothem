                    Working in the fields of transparency and accountability, mySociety thinks
                    hard and cares very much about the privacy and security of our users: the
                    length of this privacy policy is one result of that.  We know that no-one
                    reads privacy policies for fun, though, so we&rsquo;ve tried to keep it a clear
                    and reasonably quick read.

                <p>
                    We hope it covers everything you need to know, but if you still have any
                    questions please feel free to <a href="/about-contact">contact us</a>.

                <p>
                    When you use WriteToThem to contact a representative, you provide the
                    following personal information:

                    <li>
                        We will pass on your message, name, email and postal address and (if
                        given) telephone number either direct to the politician(s) you write to,
                        or, where we do not have a direct email address for the politician,
                        through an official channel (such as a council democratic services
                        department or parliamentary office) whose job it is to distribute mail
                        to representatives.

                        Note that it is common for MPs and other busy representatives to employ
                        staff who may read and respond to mail on their behalf.
                        Representatives&rsquo; offices will have and adhere to their own privacy
                        protocols.

                        admin staff may access your message in order to understand what the

                        and are unseen by humans. If you have concerns about messages which

                        We sometimes use data from WriteToThem for research. This data does not

                        receive a response from their representatives. Our Research Data Release

                    Consequences of using WriteToThem
                </h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When your representative responds to your message, their reply will go
                        directly to your email inbox. This response, and any subsequent
                        correspondence, happens outside the WriteToThem system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        WriteToThem does not operate a mailing list and there is no concept of
                        accounts or registration on the site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We will never send you unsolicited email except for the following:
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>If you submit a message but do not click the confirmation link, we
                            send you one reminder after 24 hours;</li>
                            <li>Two weeks after you send your message, we send you an automated email
                            to ask whether you received a response. If you do not respond, we send
                            you a single reminder.</li>
                            <li>On rare occasions, we pass on a message from a politician who is
                            concerned that they have mislaid emails from their constituents,
                            inviting you to re-establish contact.</li>
                        </ul>

                    As part of the process of sending your message to your representative we
                    will send you a limited number of emails, as described above. If during this
                    process you wish to stop receiving emails from us, or you are a
                    representative who no longer wishes to receive email via WriteToThem*,

                    * If you are a representative wishing to opt out of WriteToThem, we
                    encourage you to think again! WriteToThem is a system which makes it simple
                    for your constituents to contact you, where they might find other channels
                    more difficult to access. We have measures in place that prevent bulk
                    mailings and contact with representatives other than the constituents&rsquo; own.

                <p>
                    When you use WriteToThem to contact your representative, we
                    are processing your data under the legal basis 6(1)(f) of

                    out who your representatives are at different levels and
                    giving you an easy way to contact them. This is also the
                    legitimate interest we have in processing the names and
                    contact information for representatives.

                        We do not keep permanent copies of the letters you write to send to your

                    <li>
                        We store the content of your message for four weeks after it was

                        prevent abuse of the service. It also means we can include a copy of
                        your message in the questionnaire which asks if your representative has
                        responded yet, so you know which one we are talking about.
