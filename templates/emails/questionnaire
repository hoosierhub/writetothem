<?=$values['weeks_ago']?> weeks ago we sent your letter to <?=$values['recipient_name']?>, your
<?=$values['recipient_position']?>. (For reference, there's a copy of your
letter at the bottom of this email.)

Please help us understand how well representatives are doing at
responding to their constituents.

Did your <?=$values['recipient_position']?> reply to your message?

YES, they replied! - please click here:
<?=$values['yes_url']?>

YES, but I don't think my question was answered! - please click here:
<?=$values['unsatisfactory_url']?>

YES, but it was only an acknowledgement! - please click here:
<?=$values['no_url']?>

NO, but I didn't expect/require a response! - please click here:
<?=$values['not_expected_url']?>

NO, they did not reply! - please click here:
<?=$values['no_url']?>

Your feedback allows us to analyse the responsiveness
of all the politicians in the UK. We are keen to give politicians the credit
they deserve when they respond promptly to their constituents. We think it's
also worth highlighting the representatives who don't.

Please do not reply to this mail. If you have a question or comment about the
site, please send an email to <?=$values['contact_email']?>
